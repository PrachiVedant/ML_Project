# END TO END MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT


Welcome to the ML_Project repository! This project demonstrates a comprehensive machine learning workflow, covering data preparation, exploration, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. Follow the detailed steps below to reproduce or understand the project.

---

## 1. Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or above
- (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- Install required packages:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Additional dependencies may be listed in individual script headers or notebooks.

## 3. Data Preparation

- Place your dataset in the `data/` folder. Supported formats: CSV, Excel, etc.
- If needed, use the provided scripts in `scripts/data_preprocessing.py` or notebook to:
  - Load the data
  - Clean data (remove duplicates, fix data types)
  - Handle missing values (imputation or removal)
  - Encode categorical variables (LabelEncoding, OneHotEncoding)
  - Normalize or scale features (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler)
- Save processed data as `data/processed_data.csv`.

---

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Use `notebooks/eda.ipynb` or `scripts/eda.py` for:
  - Summarizing features (mean, std, unique values)
  - Checking target variable distribution
  - Visualizing data with histograms, boxplots, scatterplots
  - Identifying correlations and feature relationships
  - Spotting outliers/anomalies

---

## 5. Feature Engineering

- Transform and create new features as needed.
- Select relevant features using statistical tests or model-based importance (e.g., SelectKBest, feature_importances_).
- Document feature choices in the notebook or `report.md`.

---

## 6. Model Selection & Training

- Try multiple algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost).
- Split your data into training and test sets (e.g., 80/20 split) using `train_test_split`.
- Train models with `scripts/train.py` or corresponding notebook.
- Tune hyperparameters with GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

---

## 7. Model Evaluation

- Evaluate models using metrics:
  - Classification: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
  - Regression: RMSE, MAE, R²
- Use cross-validation for robust assessment.
- Visualize results: confusion matrix, ROC curve, feature importance, learning curves.
- Save evaluation reports in `results/`.

---

## 8. Model Deployment (Optional)

- Save trained models with `joblib` or `pickle` in `results/`.
- Use `scripts/predict.py` to make predictions on new/unseen data.
- For real-world deployment, consider wrapping model inference in a REST API (e.g., using Flask).

---

## 9. Reporting

- Summarize process, findings, and next steps in `report.md`.
- Include:
  - Data and feature summary
  - Model choices and rationale
  - Performance metrics and plots
  - Limitations and possible improvements

---

- Fork the repository and create your branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`)
- Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`)
- Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`)
- Open a pull request
